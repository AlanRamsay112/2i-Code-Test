# 2i-Code-Test

The task for this is to:

In a language of your choice, using all best practice principles you’re 
aware of, could you please provide code that iterates in multiples of A until X, 
then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. Please 
state any assumptions you’ve made. Please upload to a public Github repository 
and share the link.

The IDE used:
Apache NetBeans 12.0


The Assumptions made during this task:

In this task I assumed that until X meant for the number to keep
going up in multiplication until the chosen value for X is the answer or the
closest value that is able to be chosen.
